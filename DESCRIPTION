Description: Inference and prediction for manifold-valued data analysis. This
 		package provides a C++ implementation of the functions to create a model,
		for spatial dependent	manifold valued data, in order to perform kriging.
		In each location, specified by a vector of coordinates ([lat,long], [x,y]
		or [x,y,z]), the datum is supposed to be a symmetric and positive definite
		matrix. The algorithm exploits a projection of these data on the tangent
		space of symmetric matrices, where the tangent point is either provided by
		the user or computed as intrinsic mean of the data in input.
