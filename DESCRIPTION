Description: Predictive analysis for manifold-valued data. This package provides 
		a C++ implementation of functions to create a model for spatial dependent
		manifold-valued data, in order to perform kriging.
		In each location, specified by a vector of coordinates ([lat,long], [x,y] or 
		[x,y,z]), the datum is supposed to be a symmetric positive definite matrix. 
		The user is provided with three main functions: model_kriging, full_RDD, 
		mixed_RDD, each designed to deliver kriging predictions following the 
		corresponding algorithm (GlobalModel, FullRDD and MixedRDD), as 
		presented in the reference dissertation. They exploit, to different extents, 
		tangent space approximations, Random Domain Decomposition and 
		advanced differential geometry concepts like parallel transport.
